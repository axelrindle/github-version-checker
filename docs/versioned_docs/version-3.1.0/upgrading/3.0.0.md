# Migrating to Version 3.0.0

## Scoped Package

The packages moved to a new scope named `@version-checker`. The [old package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/version-checker) has been deprecated.

## API Changes

The return type of the check function has changed. Be sure to check out the [API docs](../../api/).

## Supported Node.js Versions

The minimum required Node.js version is [`14.16`](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.16.0/).

In case your application is using an older version of Node.js, the new [binary CLI package](../../cli/installation/#binary) might come in handy for you.
