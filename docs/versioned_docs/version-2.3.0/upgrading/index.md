# Upgrade Guide

This section contains for handling major version upgrades.

Following the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention, a major upgrade is an *incompatible API changes*.
This includes the following changes (examples):

- Supported Node.js versions
- Removing deprecated APIs
- Breaking changes in terms of functionality

I didn't quite adhere to this convention in the past but will definetely do in the future.

:::caution
Make sure your environment supports a major upgrade of dependencies.

Also consider a look into the [Changelog](https://github.com/axelrindle/github-version-checker/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
which states important changes for each release.
