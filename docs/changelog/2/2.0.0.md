# 2.0.0

> Released on `2018-05-01`

## Added

- Support for GitHub's GraphQL API.

## Changed

- The `options` object changed and requires using a [personal access token](https://blog.github.com/2013-05-16-personal-api-tokens/). See [here](https://github.com/axelrindle/version-checker#the-options-object).
- The `callback` structure changed. I decided to apply a node convention called **Error-First** in which a callback function's first parameter is the `error`. See [here](https://github.com/axelrindle/version-checker#the-callback-function-optional).
